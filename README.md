#  Generic MBean CLI Project

Generic MBean CLI is a generic Command Line Interface application that will help you with your
Java Managed Beans (MBeans). This application gives you some unique features to access and manipulate
your MBeans from the CLI. Now you do not need to create separate CLI application for all your
Java Projects. Simply use this Generic MBean CLI application to connect to your MBean Server
and find all that you need.

It is an ongoing project. Please feel free to contribute to this Project and make it even better.

## How to build

You require the following to build Generic MBean CLI:

* Latest stable [Oracle JDK 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/)
* Latest stable [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)

Note that this is build-time requirement.  JDK 6 is enough to run your Generic MBean CLI based application.
